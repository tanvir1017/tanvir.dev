# NurIt-Institute

NurIt-Institute A LMS website.

## Functionality that implemented

- User Authentication (sign up and sign in) using JWT token.
- CRUD operations for courses, lessons, topics, users etc.
- Blog functionality.
- Light & Dark Mode (Trendy)

## Challenges That I've got while implementing functionality

- Implementing the authentication system was challenging because it required understanding of how to handle cookies and tokens securely.

- Implementing user authentication was challenging as it required understanding of JSON Web Tokens(JWT).

- The database structure is complex with multiple collections interconnected which made the implementation process difficult.
